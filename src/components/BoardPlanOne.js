          Building a B quadrant business is not an easy task. You need to ask yourself
					<ol type="a" className="boardPlanOne">
            <li>Do I have what it takes?</li>
            <li>Am I willing to go beyond my comfort zone?</li>
            <li>Am I willing to be led as well as learn to lead?</li>
            <li>Is there a rich person inside of me, ready to come out?</li>
            <li>
              If “Yes” then Get clear on (with regards to Amway)
							<ol type="a">
                <li>Your expectations.</li>
                <li>Get clear on what it will take, in terms of time put in each week,</li>
                <li>as well as money,</li>
                <li>skills, and</li>
                <li>resources.</li>
                <li>Get clear on what actions you’ll need to take to make this business successful.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>No .1 things that allowed me to become rich, I say that I didn’t want anybody to tell me what to 
              do. I didn’t want job security. I wanted financial freedom. And that’s what network marketing offers.</li>
            <li>If you like somebody telling you how much you can make and when you should arrive and leave work,
               then a network marketing business is not for you.</li>
            <li>Newcomers to the networking business often make the mistake of treating their fledgling network’s 
              income as “free money” – readily disposable income from Day one. But when you have just 5, 10, 50 or 
              even 100 or 200 people in your network, your new business is still very much in the formative period. 
              It is not yet a big business.</li>
            <li>Once your network grows beyond 500 people and is getting into thousands, you have a true B quadrant
               business that is generating passive income. It is an income-generating asset.</li>
          </ol>
